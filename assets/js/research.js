      "White Blood Cells assume a significant part in noticing the ailment of a person. Leukemia and Myeloma (cancerof plasma cell) is a type of cancer which can affected the white blood cells (WBC) in bone marrow. The recognition, counting, and segmentation of white blood cells are fundamental stages in the powerful analysis of a few malignant cancers. This research purpose is to develop an automated system which is classify the leukemiaâ€™s two major cancer (ALL, AML) and plasma cells cancer Multiple Myeloma (MM) with the convolutional neural network. CNN framework (Inception-V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) are utilized to prepare the model on the bone marrow pictures to accomplish exact classification results and then using Transfer Learning to get optimized result.",

The distribution of annual mean values obtained from this model shows that it is possible to predicted weekly and monthly forecasting AQI values when we consider time series analysis for more three one year instead of just one year.",
